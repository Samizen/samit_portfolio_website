                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/01_ home_page_ albinotonnina.PNG" alt="home_page_albinotonnina">
                <p>The first website I was influenced from was http://www.albinotonnina.com/. This page influenced my home page. I was browsing through different portfolio websites for the coursework when I stumbled upon this. This website is JS heavy and uses animation via the scrolling of the wheel.</p>
                <p>What influenced me though was the clean bright vector representation of the page. The icons used was so stylish and elegant. These icons of things you would find in a table of a designer were not clickable though. I wanted to create a system of familiar icons too with clean background and a bold representation of fonts which would give me an impetus on anything I put on display.</p>
                <p>The look I managed to achieve is totally different from the website though. I have clean vector icons which are clickable which immediately grabs the attention of my website viewers. The clean background accentuates my icons and is heavily influenced from this landing page. The navigation bar system in place too needed tweaking in my website because I had to put it in top to improve the functionality for all the pages. The figure below shows my website homepage.</p>
                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/01_home.png" alt="">
                <p>The navigation is possible via the navigation bar on top and the icons below. There is also a presence of a footer in my page, again, to establish the element of familiarity within the pages.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="website-2" class="tab-panel" style="display:none">
                <h3><a href="http://www.chuckgroom.com" target="_blank">www.chuckgroom.com/</a></h3>
                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/02_about_chuck_groom.PNG" alt="chuck_groom">
                <p>My About and Portfolio page was inspired from http://www.chuckgroom.com/. He has this very clean design of a photo on top. He also has this sectioned look for separation of his paragraph about himself and the highlights of his career. The navigation bar is straightforward and bold. Most of all he has this page setup to tell you who he is with minimum fuss.</p>
                <p> I achieved to get almost similar look to my portfolio page and only difference was my color scheme.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/02_about.png" alt="about_page">
                <p>I also added a gallery of my digital and water color paintings at the bottom of my page to retain the interest of the viewers of my page. It is a simple flex display with even spacing.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="website-3" class="tab-panel" style="display:none">
                <h3><a href="http://seanhalpin.io/notes" target="_blank">http://seanhalpin.io/notes</a></h3>
                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/03_blog_sean_halpin.PNG" alt="sean_halpin">
                <p>This website http://seanhalpin.io/notes inspired my blog page with how minimalistic it is and how its accent of color just exudes personality for what he writes. A simple blog presentation of center alignment, one that Iâ€™m going for in my website. It only has a simple vector illustration and a simple writing style to get across his information in words.</p>
                <p>This is my blog page:</p>
                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/03_blog.png" alt="">

                <p>I was browsing the internet for different elements when I stumbled upon this page. I absolutely loved this tab functionality. I looked into how this was achievable and found out that simple JS and CSS could do the trick. I had this idea of containing each research pages in its own tab which would make my page smaller in height and also enhance its look.</p>
                 <p>This is what I managed to achieve:</p>
                 <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/04_research.png" alt="">
                 <!-- Img left -->
                 <p>Each webpage gets its own tab with selection bar vertical instead of horizontal. A viewer has the ability to choose between 5 websites that inspired the overall look of the website. The information you are viewing on is in the research page. </p>

                <img src="../img/Research Inspirations/05_contact_adam_hartwig.PNG" alt="adam_hartwig">
                <p>The contact page is inspired from http://www.adamhartwig.co.uk/contact. This website is on the artistic side. The overall portfolio website is just breathtaking. I wanted a visiting card like contact page and this fit the bill with its design. I have taken a similar approach to my form too. There is also a provision of form validation.</p>
